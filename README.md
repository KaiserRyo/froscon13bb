This is a native BB10 App for [FrOSCon 2013](http://froscon.org).

It displays the mobile website created by a [Python
Script](https://github.com/derpeter/Conference-Mobile-Schedule)  which is
intended to be used  with the XML output of
[Pentabarf](http://www.pentabarf.org) or
[frab](https://github.com/frab/frab).

In addition, it provides floor plans and other features, such as
triggering the phone's navigation app. It was inspired by the
 [Android version](https://github.com/derpeter/froscon2013).

In the future, this will be made more generic, and might be
using Pentabars/frab's JSON output instead of the mobile
site for conference planning.
